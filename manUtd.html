      Welcome to the fan page for the greatest sports team in the world, Manchester United Football Club.
    </p>
    <p class="expandVertically">
      Founded in 1878 as "Newton Heath", Manchester United is now one of, if not the largest sports franchises on the planet. This is in large part thanks to the dynastly of Sir Alex Ferguson who succeeded in "knocking Liverpool off their perch".
      <br>
      Manchester United's homeground is Old Trafford (pictured).
      <br>
      <br>
      Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who scored the infamous last-minute winner in the 1999 Champions League Final against Bayern Munich is currently our manager. Ole has full support of United fans and we all look forward to him steering us back in the right direction, that is back toward the path that Sir Alex has lead us toward. That path involves fast-flowing, attacking football; as well as trust in youth. Unfortunately, the managers since Sir Alex's retirement: David Moyes; Louis Van Gaal; and Jose Mourinho; have steered us off of that path.
      <br>
      <br>
      Hopefully Ole can add his name to the shortlist of legendary United managers:
      <br>
      <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sir Alex Ferguson</li>
        <li>Sir Matt Busby</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
      However here is the list of managers starting with the most recent down to Busby:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</li>
        <li>Jose Mourinho</li>
        <li>Louis Van Gaal</li>
        <li>Ryan Giggs</li>
        <li>David Moyes</li>
        <li>Sir Alex Ferguson</li>
        <li>Ron Atkinson</li>
        <li>Dave Sexton</li>
